<h1><p style="color:aquamarine">Computers in Healthcare - MEDICAL IMAGING - X-ray Technology</h1>

<img src="images/cover.jpg" alt="Enhancing Social Good in Computing"
</ul><p><p style="color:white">The evolution of computer technology has had a dramatic impact on society's healthcare and medicine. In particular, medical imaging technology has significantly contributed to healthcare services such as diagnosis, early detection, treatment approach and monitoring progress.  Advanced medical imaging has improved the results of treatments on patients and subsequently requires a less invasive procedure; hence, it has contributed to in-depth medical research and education. </p>
<p><p style="color:white"> There are many types of medical imaging technologies that exist, but in this research paper, we will be focusing on X-ray technology. This technology is widely used in various medical diagnoses, such as detecting fractures, tumours, silicosis, foreign objects or other abnormalities. (National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, June 2022). Nevertheless, this research will also focus on radiation exposure risks, such as the chances of developing cancers later in life and tissue effects.</p>​
