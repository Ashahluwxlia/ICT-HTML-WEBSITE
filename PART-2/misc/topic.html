When he covered the tube with dark paper, he found a new kind of invisible radiation: X-rays (with 'X' meaning unknown). These X-rays had short waves and could go through human skin but not through bones, making bone shadows on a screen. Roentgen's important work earned him the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901, and it started the way we take pictures inside the body today.​

First use of X-rays in the medical field​

The first use of X-rays under clinical conditions was by John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England, on 11 January 1896, when he radiographed a needle stuck in the hand of an associate. On February 14, 1896, Hall-Edwards was also the first to use X-rays in a surgical</p></em>
